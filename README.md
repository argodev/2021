# 2021 Learning Topics and Notes

This repository is primarily for the benefit of the author and will serve as a dumping ground for the notes, code, and other artifacts for the topics I am studying in 2021. This is part of my attempt to be deliberate in my study and skill development. I expect that [my blog](https://robgillen.com) will eventually contain some polished output from this study and I will aim to update this page with the appropriate links when that happens.

## Schedule

* January/February: [Assembly Language](assembly/README.md)
* March/April: [C/C++](c_cpp/README.md)
* May/June: [Reverse Engineering](reverse_engineering/README.md)
* July/August: [Fuzzing](fuzzing/README.md)
* September/October: [Memory Allocation](memory_allocation/README.md)
* November/December: [CTFs/Post-Exploitation](ctf_post_exploit/README.md)


## Papers

One of my professional goals for 2021 is to read at least one vulnerability science-related paper or long-form blog post each week with the intent of both staying knowledgeable with the current trends and research as well as deepening my understanding of various techniques. This serves as a list of those that I have read.
