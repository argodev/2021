# 2021 Learning Topics and Notes

This repository is primarily for the benefit of the author and will serve as a dumping ground for the notes, code, and other artifacts for the topics I am studying in 2021. This is part of my attempt to be deliberate in my study and skill development. I expect that [my blog](https://robgillen.com) will eventually contain some polished output from this study and I will aim to update this page with the appropriate links when that happens.
