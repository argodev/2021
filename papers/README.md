# 2021 Papers

One of my professional goals for 2021 is to read at least one vulnerability science-related paper or long-form blog post each week with the intent of both staying knowledgeable with the current trends and research as well as deepening my understanding of various techniques. This serves as a list of those that I have read.

1. [An iOS hacker tries Android](01/README.md)
1. [Reversing TL-WR840N](02/README.md)
