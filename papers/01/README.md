Author's Objective: Given two known/documented vulnerabilities in a kernel driver for Android, could he turn those into a full-blown kernel exploit (he previously only had experience with iOS).





## Takeaways

1. I was struck as I read this paper, how often the author referenced other vulns/exploits as idea fodder for his next step or as a means of getting un-stuck. This really drove home to me the value of reading and deeply understanding existing attacks/vulns.
