# Emulating a Raspberry Pi

While it may not be immediately obvious how this is related to assembly language programming, this tutorial is tied to my main objectives of developing expertise as a vulnerability science researcher in two ways. First, many of the assembly language tutorials I have been reading focus on ARM-based assembly and this should provide a suitable means for testing this code. Secondly, a large portion of my group has been using emulation for various purposes and at this point I have no real experience with it. The objective, therefore, is to gain a little experience with emulation while also establishing a platform for ARM-based assembly programming that doesn't require me to have an RPI sitting and available to program.

As with most of the items on this site, this information is not unique to me. I will be working through a [tutorial](https://azeria-labs.com/emulate-raspberry-pi-with-qemu/) provided by [@Fox0x01](https://twitter.com/fox0x01) and [@azeria_labs](https://twitter.com/azeria_labs).

## Setup

I wasted quite a bit of time trying to get my remote development enviornment working. I have an Ubuntu-based desktop in my office that is a beefy box and is perfect for this sort of thing. Additionally, it has VMWare Workstation installed and I would prefer to use that machine/VM instance as a "central" spot for this sort of work rather than having it installed on my laptop. This _shouldn't_ be too hard.

### Problem #1: VMWare is out of date

I updated my machine (normal patches) and rebooted. Without thinking about it, this caused a kernel update, which is normally no big deal. However, since I am currently interacting with the machine remotely, _and_ my machine is configured to only allow `sudo` with smartcard-based authentications, I was somewhat stuck. I tried a number of things, with `xforwarding` enabled, but couldn't get it to go... I kept getting prompted for my credentials in a way that wouldn't really process them. Then, I tried from a local Linux box with xforwarding and it sort of worked, but would fail under sudo to do xforwarding. I [found a little write-up](https://blog.mobatek.net/post/how-to-keep-X11-display-after-su-or-sudo/) that gave me some hints as to what to do.

```bash
# create an xauthority file for the root user
sudo touch /root/.Xauthority

# take my user's xauthority info and dump it into the root's
sudo xauth add $(xauth -f ~<username>/.Xauthority list|tail -1)

# get persistent sudo
sudo -i

# run vmware to trigger privileged updates to kernel
vmware
```

Now, I should be able to run vmware remotely.

### Problem #2: VMWare over XFowarding is painfully slow

Not sure there is a good solution here... it is what it is.

### Problem #3: VNC server isn't working 

There is a VNC server built-in to Ubuntu, but it is not properly configured, and there are [some known bugs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/999) with trying to configure/enable it remotely. I expect that, if I were able to sit directly at the console, I'd be fine, but alas, that is not currently an option.

Therefore, I (loosely) followed a [writeup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-vnc-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart) that got me going. Once everything was installed and happy, I did something like the following:

```bash
# connect via SSH with proper port-forwarding
ssh -L 59000:localhost:5901 -C user@machine

# start the VNC server (I don't really want it running all the time)
vncserver -localhost -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 24

# connect to it via a regular VNC client

# kill the server when I'm done
vncserver -kill :1
```

With this in place, I was able to connect to the desktop via the Real VNC Viewer and drive VMWare Workstation with a reasonable level of performance. Now, I am _finally_ able to pick back up with the original tutorial.

### Configuring VM

I elected to utilize a VM to support the emulation. I set up an Ubuntu 20.04 desktop VM and fully patched it.

### Getting needed bits

Next, I downloaded the latest version of Raspberry PI OS. Specifically, I grabbed [https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2021-01-12/2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.zip](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_armhf/images/raspios_armhf-2021-01-12/2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.zip). I extracted the zip file to `~/Downloads/2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img`.

The other key item is the qemu kernel. Starting at [the linked github site](https://github.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel), I downloaded the latest version-4 kernel. Specifically, [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel/master/kernel-qemu-4.19.50-buster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhruvvyas90/qemu-rpi-kernel/master/kernel-qemu-4.19.50-buster).

### Preparing my Machine

The following steps are self-explanatory and commented inline

```bash
# make a working directory and copy the downloaded bits into it
mkdir ~/qemu_vms
cd ~/qemu_vms
cp ~/Downloads/*.img .
cp ~/Downloads/kernel* .

# install qemu
sudo apt-get install qemu-system

# inspect the image file
fdisk -l ./2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img

Disk ./2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img: 3.71 GiB, 3963617280 bytes, 7741440 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x904a3764

Device                                 Boot  Start     End Sectors Size Id Type
./2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img1        8192  532479  524288 256M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
./2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img2      532480 7741439 7208960 3.4G 83 Linux
```

We see that the filesystem (.img2) starts at sector 532480. Now take that value and multiply it by 512, in this case itâ€™s 512 * 532480 = 272629760 bytes. Use this value as an offset in the following command:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/raspbian
sudo mount -v -o offset=272629760 -t ext4 ~/qemu_vms/2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img /mnt/raspbian

# now edit the ld preload
sudo vim /mnt/raspbian/etc/ld.so.preload
# comment out the one line in that file ('#') and then save/exit

# check fstab for any mmcblk0 entries
sudo vim /mnt/raspbian/etc/fstab

# if found (I didn't find any)...
# 1. Replace the first entry containing /dev/mmcblk0p1 with /dev/sda1
# 2. Replace the second entry containing /dev/mmcblk0p2 with /dev/sda2, save and exit.

# unmount the image
cd ~/
sudo umount /mnt/raspbian
```

Now we are ready to try to run it in an emulator. The following command should do it:

```bash

# NOTE: I changed the cpu and memory from the tutorial based on what the data sheet stated
# was accurate.
qemu-system-aarch64 -kernel ~/qemu_vms/kernel-qemu-4.19.50-buster -cpu cortex-a72 -m 256 -M versatilepb -serial stdio -append "root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 rw" -hda ~/qemu_vms/2021-01-11-raspios-buster-armhf.img -redir tcp:5022::22 -no-reboot
```

As noted in the comments above, the Raspberry Pi 4 uses the [ARM Cortex-A72 chip](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2711/README.md)
